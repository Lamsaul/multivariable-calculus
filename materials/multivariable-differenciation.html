<h1>Derivatives of Multivariable Functions</h1>
<h2>The Idea</h2>
<ul>
        <li>Multivariable functions take \( n \) independent variables to return the value of one dependent variable.</li>
        <li>While a function \( f(x) \) may be a line or more generally a curve in 2-D, a function \( f(x,y) \) will extend to 3-D as a <em>surface</em>.</li>
        <li>The derivative of this function at some point in this case wouldn't simply be the gradient of the tangent <em>line</em> to the surface as it'd be too ambiguous due to the number of tangent lines that can be drawn against the surface, all with varying directions.</li>
        <li>To find the gradient of the tangent line to a surface at a point, we have to give it a direction.</li>
        <li>This direction can, in the most simple cases, be the \( \hat{i} \) or \( \hat{j} \) in 3 dimensions, and can be extended along any unit vector in the plane of the independent variables as a general <em>directional derivative</em>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Directional Derivatives along \(\hat{i}\) and \(\hat{j}\)</h2>
<ul>
    <li>When we calculate the gradient along the \( x \) direction (along \( \hat{i} \)), we'd have to contain the tangent line in a plane parallel to the \( xz \) plane.</li>
    <li>Since this only contains the \( x \) axis, we will require \( y \) to be a constant.</li>
    <li>And similarly, when we calculate the gradient along the \( y \) direction, we require \( x \) to be a constant.</li>
    <li>This idea of treating a variable as a constant and thereby ensuring that the tangent line is in the direction of the other variable is called a <strong>partial derivative</strong>.</li>
    <li>Notation for a partial derivative with respect to \( x \): 
        \[
        \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} \text{ or } f_x
        \]
    </li>
</ul>
<h2>Directional Derivatives along \(\hat{u}\) </h2>
<ul>
    <li>If we were to extend the idea for calculating the derivative only along the axis of one independent variable, we'd encounter directional derivatives that can be calculated along any direction \(\hat{u}=u_1 \hat{i} + u_2 \hat{j}\) where \(\hat{u}\) is a <i>unit</i> vector on the plane of independent variables. </li>
    <li>This directional derivative is denoted, for some function \(f(x,y)\) and vector \(\hat{u}\) as \(D_{\hat{u}} f(x,y)\) and is calculated as: </li>
    \[D_{\hat{u}} f(x,y) = f_x u_1 + f_y u_2\]
    <li>This expression can be rewritten as a dot product, which gives us the vector \( \hat{u} \) on one side and a 'weird' vector containing the derivatives with respect to each independent variable as components to the axis unit vectors of those respective independent variables:
        \[
        D_{\hat{u}} f(x,y) = (f_x \hat{i} + f_y \hat{j}) \cdot (u_1 \hat{i} + u_2 \hat{j})
        \]
    </li>
    <li>This 'weird' vector is called the gradient vector and is denoted as \( \nabla f \). The expression for \( D_{\hat{u}} f(x,y) \) can hence be rewritten as:
        \[
        D_{\hat{u}} f(x,y) = \nabla f \cdot \hat{u}
        \]
    </li>
</ul>
<h2>Tangent Lines and Planes</h2>
<ul>
    <li>\( \nabla f \) is the normal to the level curve of \( f(x,y) = c \).</li>
    <li>\( \nabla f \) is the normal to the level surface of \( f(x,y,z) = d \).</li>
    <li>Tangent lines and planes both need the normal vector.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Example: Determining tangent and normal <em>lines</em> (2-D)</h3>
<ul>
    <li>As an example, take \( x^2 - y^2 = 16 \). To find the tangent line and normal line, we can 'cheat' by pretending that this is a level curve to some surface in \( \mathbb{R}^3 \).</li>
    <li>Doing so, we get something like: \( f(x,y) = x^2 - y^2 \) (assuming that 16 was some value of \( c \) in \( f(x,y) = c \)).</li>
    <li>This would give us \( \nabla f(x,y) = 2x \hat{i} - 2y \hat{j} \), which can be interpreted as the normal vector to any level curve \( x^2 - y^2 = c \).</li>
    <li>An example point \( P(5,3) \) gives a *specific normal* to the level curve \( x^2 - y^2 = 16 \). To determine that normal, we first need to determine \( \nabla f(5,3) \):
        \[
        \nabla f(5,3) = 10 \hat{i} - 6 \hat{j}
        \]
    </li>
    <li>The gradient of the normal line can hence be determined as:
        \[
        m_N = \frac{-6}{10} = \frac{-3}{5}
        \]
    </li>
    <li>The equation can be obtained easily as:
        \[
        y - 3 = -\frac{3}{5}(x - 5) \Rightarrow y = -\frac{3}{5}x + 6
        \]
    </li>
    <li>As the tangent is perpendicular to the normal, its gradient should be \( \frac{5}{3} \), letting us obtain the equation of the tangent as:
        \[
        y - 3 = \frac{5}{3}(x - 5) \Rightarrow y = \frac{5}{3}x - \frac{16}{3}
        \]
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>Example: Determining tangent <em>planes</em> (3-D)</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Take \( -x^2 + y^2 - z^2 = 4 \) and a point \( P(1,3,2) \) on it. Similar to the previous example, we can treat this as a level <em>surface</em> in \( \mathbb{R}^4 \).</li>
    <li>Doing so, we again get something like: \( f(x,y,z) = -x^2 + y^2 - z^2 \), an equation of 4 dimensions.</li>
    <li>\( f(x,y,z) = 4 \) is the level surface (out of a family of level surfaces) that contains the point \( P(1,3,2) \).</li>
    <li>We can obtain the normal vector to this particular level surface at \( P(1,3,2) \) by calculating \( \nabla f(1,3,2) \):
        \[
        \nabla f = -2 \hat{i} + 6 \hat{j} - 4 \hat{k}
        \]
    </li>
    <li>The equation of the tangent plane can hence be obtained using the general Cartesian equation of a plane:
        \[
        a(x - x_0) + b(y - y_0) + c(z - z_0) = 0
        \]
    </li>
    <li>Here, \( a,b,c \) represent the components of \( \hat{i}, \hat{j}, \) and \( \hat{k} \) respectively of the vector that is normal to the plane. So, the equation of the tangent plane is:
        \[
        -2(x - 1) + 6(y - 3) - 4(z - 2) = 0
        \]
        \[
        -2x + 2 + 6y - 18 - 4z + 8 = 0 \Rightarrow -2x + 6y - 4z = 8
        \]
    </li>
